# cpp-playground-template
A template C++ project for myself to use as a base playground for hobby projects 

I might try to make it more convenient in the future. Probably will be including a foo_test folder...

In order to build and run use predefined scripts:
```
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```
